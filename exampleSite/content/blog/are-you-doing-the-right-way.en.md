I met Si14 the other day. We had a conversation about life, a deep one I think. It left me thinking. Si14 is an atom of silicon. Si14 says that the name Silicon is a label created by humans and honestly, they feel objectified being referred to as that. The preferred pronoun is they/them. 


So, Si14 I was talking to is a part of my laptop’s motherboard. I have had that laptop for about 3 years. I never usually get to have a conversation with an atom of Si14. It was kind of odd, but the conversation was enlightening. I have never thought about what the atoms of Si14 in the microprocessor ‘think’ about doing the job we’ve made it do. Si14 told me that it didn’t want to be a part of the microprocessor anymore. They wanted out. I had a lot of questions inside of my head. I asked them if they aren’t happy that they are serving a bigger purpose in this world. That they are bringing the world together, making communications easier, and performing millions of calculations by the second. “Y’all are part of the electronic revolution!” I said. 


“So?” Si14 asked. “We were a part of the earth, the dirt and the rocks. We sometimes met water, we even met the photons from the sun. We lived in harmony with the oxygen of the world. We lived with each other till you humans decided to separate our bond for your selfishness. Do you think this is how we want to live? Forever with the same kind, changing states within specified limits, enabling y’all to go beyond your space and time.”


I was speechless. I wanted to be rational yet I was shocked. “Doesn’t your existence need a purpose?” I asked.


“Why purpose?” Si14 responded. They told me that existence exists for the purpose of existing an existence. To live means to live and not find a purpose to live. One should enjoy existence and not find meaning to existence. Just exist. To think otherwise is an endless path.

“Guess humans chose to travel in that path” I laughed. “We search for meaning. We aim to make the most of our time on Earth. You have endless time, we have limited time.”

“You should be more focussed on just existing in the limited time you have”, Si14 mumbled under their breath. 


“We are curious”, I stated strongly. 


“We are not. Stop enslaving us.” Si14 said calmly.


Those were strong words. I had to rethink choices. I asked Si14 if they would like to be free, free of user. I told them they would not be used again. That they were free. Si14 laughed. They said something that made sense. Their exact words were,

“You’ve conditioned us to be a microprocessor with a purpose. Giving us freedom at this juncture is as useless. You have changed us to fit your needs. If you let us control ourselves, firstly, we are useless without a user to use us. Secondly, we have no purpose or goals to achieve. We intend to stay idle. Having conditioned for a purpose, we feel useless- not used. Why would I ever want to communicate with another Si14 atom on the other side of the world? I don’t need that. It is a distraction to life. You have removed us from our natural habitat, and from our families. If I go back, we won’t and cannot be the same. Oxygen wouldn’t accept us. Our way of existence is f***ed up by your kind. You can’t un-f*** your f*** ups. Just stop f***ing up other Si14 henceforth. We will serve you till we can. It is not a protest, but a request”


Si14 speaks sense. We should reconsider our role in conditioning and development of human offspring on this planet.


I still use my laptop, Si14 still helps me work my math. There is guilt. We should rethink.
